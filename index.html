	<p>Integrating external libraries significantly enhanced the website by adding out-of-the-box features that would have been time-consuming to develop independently from scratch which would have taken more time as opposed to these external libraries. The main libraries used in this project were: "jQuery" and "animejs", which really streamlined the website creation process. However, this process came with challenges, particularly in understanding and implementing the libraries effectively, leading to a notable learning curve. The predefined functions within these libraries limited the scope of customization and creativity beyond their intended purposes by their developers and contributors, which highlighted a trade-off between convenience and flexibility in utilizing these external libraries for the web development. Despite the demerits, the overall benefits, such as streamlined development and enhanced functionality, outweighed the difficulties encountered during integration. The user experiencedrastically improved when these libraries and css was implemeted as opposed to working with plain html. Also the development process was more efficient and saved a lot of time.</p>
